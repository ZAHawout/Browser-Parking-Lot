# Browser Parking Lot

Hosting: http://ZAHawout.github.io/Browser-Parking-Lot

The objective of this project is to store useful links with a todo item that can be prioritized using the labels HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.

An item contains:

- a link

- a short text description

- date of creation

- priority label (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`)

The Browser Parking Lot enables you to eliminate tabs in your browser. Therefore, we reduce memory consumption of your computer, because using the browser as a todo list is counterproductive.

As a student, I want to be able to organize tutorial videos so that I can easily access the information later on.

As a Youtuber, I want to be able to organize several video links so I can easily cross reference information.
